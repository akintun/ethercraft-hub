## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18.x or later recommended) and an `npm`-compatible package manager installed on your machine.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/akintun-ethercraft-hub.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd akintun-ethercraft-hub
    ```
3.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add your WalletConnect `projectId`.
    ```env
    VITE_WAGMI_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_PROJECT_ID_HERE"
    ```
    *You can get a `projectId` from [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/).*

### Running the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
